Lep Garden App Builder Description

The lep garden app builder allows the user to create a garden with certain conditions, a budget, and dimensions. The user is then able to drag a hexagon shape to 
create the overall garden shape with scaled plants that are based of the user input of dimension. Following this step, users can drag and drop plants if and only if their
conditions match what the user has selected into the garden. The plants available are sorted by leps supported. The user can also click see full inventory to see all 100 
plants in our inventory, as well as sort the plants by their conditions and A-Z or leps supported. The user can also click the lep supported button to see which leps are
supported in our garden out of the sampled leps we have found in our data. Saving, loading, and restarting are all options in the software that a user can perform when they
are finished with their garden. Users can also finish their garden, which automatically saves the garden and brings the user to a screen where they can see all 
plants they have planted, as well as the quantity and total price. If the user decides, they can then print their plant list. Finally, on the home screen, a user can learn
more about leps by clicking on the lep motivation button. A working link to the mt cuba center is also available to learn more about native plants.
